Allows you to download, share, and watch replays as if they were your own in Valorant's replay system.

> Currently in early development, expect bugs and missing features. The app is not yet feature complete and may be unstable.

## Project Status 
As of [Patch 12.10](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-12-10/), Valorant now supports viewing replays from friends directly through the official replay system.

This is the significantly easier and more TOS-friendly approach for most users.

  <summary>How It Works</summary>

  ### General Connection

  VRV connects to the local Riot Client and uses your session credentials to query Valorant endpoints and observe data exposed through the Riot Messaging Service (RMS).

  This allows the application to, for example:

  - Track your current gameflow state
  - Query replay metadata
  - Download replay files

  ### Replay loading
  Valorant normally prevents replay files from being renamed, replaced, or loaded arbitrarily. Replays that do not match the expected file are typically shown as unavailable or fail to load.

  Based on observed behavior, it appears that Valorant validates a replay file before entering the replay-loading process, but does not perform the same validation again immediately before consuming the file. The exact implementation is undocumented and this behavior has not been independently verified.

  VRV takes advantage of this behavior by monitoring gameflow events through RMS. Once the client transitions into the replay-loading state, VRV replaces the target replay file with the desired replay while preserving the expected file name and location.

  As a result, the replay system loads the replacement replay instead of the originally selected one.

  This approach does not require code injection, memory modification, or changes to the Valorant game process itself.

  <summary>FAQ</summary>
  
  ### Can I get banned?

  I am unsure.
  
  VRV uses undocumented Riot Client APIs and interacts with endpoints that are normally only accessed by Riot's official clients. As a result, its use may violate Riot Games' Terms of Service.
  VRV does not modify the Valorant game process, provide a competitive advantage, expose hidden information, or affect competitive integrity. Its functionality is limited to replay-related features and interactions with the Riot Client.
  Ultimately, any enforcement decisions are made by Riot Games, and use of VRV is at your own risk.

  ### Does VRV modify Valorant?

  No.
  
  VRV does not modify the game client or inject code into the game process.

  ### Can I watch old replays?

  Sometimes.

  VRV attempts to estimate replay compatibility based on the build version of the replay and the currently installed Valorant client.

  If the replay and client differ by a major or minor version, the UI will prevent the replay from being loaded. Replays from older patch versions within the same major/minor version are marked as Outdated and can still be selected.
  However, this compatibility check is only a best-effort estimate. Even if a replay is marked as playable, there is no guarantee that it will load successfully. Incompatible replays may fail to load or cause the game to crash while loading.
